Information
</p>
Here are some makefiles that I demonstrated during the lecture for you <b>to study and 
experiment with</b>. There is nothing to submit for this practice.
<p>

Remember, there are two types of students. <i>Which one do you want to be?</i>


<p>
Don't forget that the first character on the indented action/recipe lines <b>MUST</b> be the tab character.
This is one situation where you do not want to replace tabs with spaces. If you do, the makefile will
not work.
<p>
To work with these makefiles, save them from the links below. 
<b>DO NOT</b> copy and paste the code from this page. Why? Because you may not get the tab characters 
when you do that. Also, the makefile files have a <tt>.txt</tt> extension so that they can be more 
easily viewed in a browser. You should remove that file extension.
<p>
You will need your <tt>scantext</tt>, <tt>jumble</tt>, and <tt>spellcheck</tt> source and header files 
from CS120. Here is a <a href="main.c">main.c</a> to use.
<p>
Make sure that you create the <tt><b>gnu</b></tt> directory before you run
make.

<p class="technote">
The scantext assignment did not have a header file. The functions were simply prototyped in the driver.
You will need to create a header file yourself. Simply prototype the 4 functions in a file named
<tt>scantext.h</tt> and you should be good to go.
</p>

<p>
<a href="makefile-gnu.txt">GNU makefile with macros</a> (with tabs). Run as: <tt>make -f makefile-gnu</tt>
or rename it to just <tt>makefile</tt> and you'll just have to type: <i>make</i>

<blockquote><pre>

as a test.

<b>Additional practice:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Add or modify rules/recipes to run, diff, and tablen the output, as well. You'll need
    to create a master output file.</li>
<p>
  <li>Add or modify rules/recipes to also run Doxygen. You will need to Doxygenize the
    source files, of course.</li>
<p>
  <li>For those that have <b>clang</b> installed and working, make a <tt>clang</tt>
    directory and use the <tt>makefile-gnu</tt> file to build the project in the
    <tt>clang</tt> directory. DO NOT modify <tt>makefile-gnu</tt>. Override
    the relevant macros on the command line. 
    (The name of the compiler is <tt>clang</tt> and the compiler options are the same
    as <tt>gcc</tt>.)</li>
<p>
     <li>If you are familiar with Microsoft's compiler and options, 
     create a makefile that will allow you build the project with that
     compiler.</li>

<p>
  <li>Practice overriding other macros (e.g. <tt>CLFAGS</tt>, <tt>EXE</tt>) from
    the command line.</li>
<p>
  <li>If the build, run, and diff were successful, modify the rule to then
    zip up all of the source files that would be uploaded to the submission 
    server (had this been a real assignment).</li>
<p>
  <li>If you are familiar with revision control systems (RCS), add a rule that will
    put the files into the RCS. You might invoke make like this:
<blockquote><pre>
make git
</pre></blockquote>
    which would put the modified source files into the version control system
    (whichever system you are using). You wouldn't want to add this to the 
    primary rule, as it would put the files into RCS <b>every time</b> that 
    you modified the code!
    </li>
</ol>

<p class="technote">
It should be pretty obvious by now that using makefiles can significantly reduce the amount
of repetitive work that you have to do. This is why <b>make</b> was created. 
As we all know, programmers are inherently lazy when it comes to repetition!
<br><br>
With a little
effort up front, you can save a lot of effort later.
Not only 
does it reduce the workload, but once the makefile is created, it removes any
possibility of making errors and guarantees that every step is executed in the
proper order, e.g. you'll never forget to run tablen again!
